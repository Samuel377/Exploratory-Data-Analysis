Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It helps us understand the dataset's underlying structure, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions. This article will guide you through pe
rforming EDA using SQL, covering essential steps from understanding the data to deriving meaningful insights.
